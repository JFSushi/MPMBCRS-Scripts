# MPMBCRS-Scripts
Custom scripts for MPMP's Character Record Sheet

A collection of scripts that can be added to [MPMB's Character Record Sheet](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet) to support the newest 5e content.

# Using scripts
To apply scripts, open MPMB's sheet and go to bookmarks. Under functions, click on 'Add Custom Script'. From there, copy/paste your desired scripts in the textbox. If you're adding a large amount of scripts, you might have to open a second (or more) dialog by clicking 'Open Another Dialog', as there is a 63642 character limit per page.
